# Introduction
Road accidents have become very common nowadays. As more and people are buying automobiles, the incidences of road accidents are just increasing day by day. 
As per WHO observatory data “Road traffic injuries are currently estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death across all age groups globally and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030”.

Analyzing an important array of factors, including weather conditions, speed, construction work, special events, traffic jams among others, an accurate prediction of the severity of the accidents can be performed.

These perceptions, could allow law enforcement bodies to allocate their resources more effectively in advance of potential accidents, preventing when and where a severe accident can occur as well as saving both, time and money. In addition, this knowledge of a severe accident situation can be warned to drivers so that they would drive more carefully or even change their route if it is possible or to hospital which could have set everything ready for a severe intervention in advance.

Governments should be highly interested in accurate predictions of the severity of an accident, in order to reduce the time of arrival and thus save a significant amount of people each year. Other attentive private companies could be investing in technologies aiming to improve road safeness.
